  <mark>WHAT IS A FEMBOY ◑﹏◐?</mark>

  Hard question innit, but hopefully scrounging around all these definitions you'll figure it out. And i don't 
  want to push you into believing my own opinion of what a femboy is yet to come to a conclusion of your own 
  from multiple sources. b(￣▽￣)d

  <smark>My Opinion</smark>

  But if you want my opinion on the definition of a femboy, a femboy is a person who identifies as male and 
  dresses and or acts feminine (wearing usually thigh highs and a skirt), usually young not to be confused with 
  ladyboys and being a femboy isnt the same as being a cross dresser as femboys try to dress as cute feminine 
  boys; not cute girls and being a femboy isn't necessarily LGBT but theres a sizeable overlap.

  But to get a better understanding of what a femboy is mabye check out the femboy statistics section.

  <mark>CLOTHING IDEAS</mark>
	
  There is no one femboy look or outfit but here is some types of clothing that i feel define the femboy
  aesthetic or are just plain cute! Here is some suggestions & ideas you could think about. (oﾟvﾟ)ノ

  Thigh Highs/Stockings - there adorable and an essential for your average femboy & come in a huge variety of 
  colours. but warning in my experience parring them with thigh garter could lead to them not last as long so be
  warned when using thigh garter in conjunction with them

 <img src="Clothing_Ideas_Images/Thigh_High.png" style="width:500px;height:469px;margin-left: 23px">

  Skirts - they are are adorable and by law you must give a skirt a big spin the second you put one on for 
  the first time or lord astolfo will banish you to hell, a place wheres skirts & stockings do not exist!

 <img src="Clothing_Ideas_Images/Skirts.png" style="width:449px;height:460px;margin-left: 23px">

  Chokers - man trying these on for the first time they don't call em chokers for nothing! (╯▽╰ ") But 
  there a super cute thingy to add onto your fit. But if your a closeted femboy be warned if you put them 
  on to tight they can leave in imprint & then your cover could be blown so be careful!

 <img src="Clothing_Ideas_Images/Chockers.png" style="width:500px;height:477px;margin-left: 23px">

  Thigh garter - for a long time i never knew the word for this cute piece of clothing. But when i saw one 
  i was in love! o(≧u≦)o if you hate your thigh highs falling down get some thigh garter to hold them up plus 
  they look super cute. but be warned at least in my experience they lead to some of my thigh highs breaking much 
  quicker

  Fish nets - they are really cute but there a battle to put on & break so easily but man there cute.

 <img src="Clothing_Ideas_Images/Fishnets.png" style="width:450px;height:585px;margin-left: 23px">

  Tights - if you want something more conservative then thigh highs & a soft different texture try out tights.

  Gym shorts - a cute piece of the femboy aesthetic gym shorts can be added to any femboy fit.

  Maid outfits - a femboys dream the maid outfit oh lord astolfo the cuteness this outfit has and embodies.

  XL clothing - now some may disagree with me here but a huge tshirt or comfy hoodie can be a great part of a 
  femboy fit.

  Hand Warmers - hand warmers can be a little cute addition to femboy fit. they may make moving your hands a 
  bit hard but ehh no pain no gain innit.

  Cat Ears - a cute piece of clothing & no its not furry id say its neko but ehh cat ears are cute. (:

  Belt - a belt can smothen out your waistline & bring more attention to your boy tum.

  Crop top - if you've got pride of your boy tum if you want to you can where a crop top hoodie or tshirt 
  to show it off.

  Mask - if your not a big fan of your face then covering it up with a mask may make you feel more confident
  im British so i can related<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpUSKE9p_M" target="_blank">.</a>

  Jewellery - some cute dangly earrings or some big hoops can but super cute to a femboy fit.

 <img src="Clothing_Ideas_Images/Jewllery.png" style="width:500px;height:515px;margin-left: 23px">

  Hair Clips - they can be used to make your tied up hair cuter or can adorn the front of your face 

 <img src="Clothing_Ideas_Images/Hair_Clips.png" style="width:425px;height:417px;margin-left: 23px">

  Make Up - some eyeliner or mascara can really look cute

  <mark>PLACES NOT RECOMMENED TO SHOP AT ⊘ </mark>

  Etsy.com if your buying skirts it seems to have a lot of cute skirts. But then you do a little digging
  a realise a lot of skirts there are bought of aliexpress and then resold at a higher price etsy is 
  still great for a lot of things especially more niche or unique stuff but yeah just be careful

  Also never shop at Shein there low prices are only low due to child labour or if your financially not 
  the best just try not too. heres a video about the company - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv6iK2kS3qQ&list=PLSbFZp8s7tcxaEIlxRCGcBcGPoTL3Bvf6&index=22" target="_blank">Link</a>

  TheBodyShop can look like a simple place that sells cosmetics but really is a well known multi level 
  marketing scheme heres a video about it - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6YqZ8-1uwk" target="_blank">Link</a>

  <mark>SHAVING щ(ʘ╻ʘ)щ</mark>

  So here is some links to guides and discussions other femboys have made also check femboy guides
  section & some of the videos there can also help you.

  <mark>FITNESS</mark>

  Now im not to educated on fitness so i wont say much but don't go overboard or starve your self just
  think about simply eating less and think about calories in calories out as a important concept and to 
  lose weight focus on cardio with squats crunches sit ups and leg stretches mixed with a good diet where 
  you don't eat to much.

  For me when i started out as a femboy i was too fat to fit into most skirts i wanted with a waistline 
  of 37 inches. I was just slightly above average weight but the idea of cute femboy skirts inspired me 
  to work out and improve my weight and fitness. Working out shouldn't be this thing you dread because
  it can be really fun and eventually i lost all that weight and my waistline is around 28 inches now. 
  I can fit into medium sized women size skirts fine and its great but honestly one thing i didn't know 
  before getting into fitness was how much your legs would ache pretty much don't work out everyday, you 
  need of days to recover. Even if you really enjoying working out don't over do it as you can hurt 
  yourself but that's just my advice from anecdotal experience that ive given because i want to help and
  motivate you but id highly recommend looking up what more qualified people say about fitness and what 
  well research scientific evidence says about fitness. Good luck with keeping your self healthy as being 
  able to fit into medium size clothing can open up the amount of femboy drip you can wear a lot.

  and squats are key woohoho!

  <mark>FEMININE BODY LANGUAGE</mark>

  Whats body language is defined as feminine? its is hard to pin down but i feel sitting cross legged is 
  feminine. Putting your ankle together yet your feet apart can also feel feminine, playing with
  your hair can be feminine yet some ive heard can find it flirtatious 
<h2 id="C7" style="color:lightpink;"> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <mark>MALE TO FEMALE SIZE GRAPHS</mark>
	
  Before becoming a femboy I did not realize how different the average male body was to a females, especially
  waistline wise average male waistline is around 35inches while the average female waistline is like 
  29inches. Do you really have to pay attention to sizing here is a chart for skirt sizes and on the site 
  there is loads of sizing charts.

  Ok so you've found a femboy online you wanna meet up with amazing! us femboys hardly ever are able to meet up    
  with fellow femboys due to overbearing family or femboys being rare to find regardless if your meeting up with   
  one be safe.                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                   
  1. Meet in a very public area like a busy train station, a local high street, a town center or a restaurant.     
                                                                                                                   
  2. Reverse image search images of them to make sure there who they say you are.                                  
                                                                                                                   
  3. Tell a close person you trust what your doing. Because you don't want to suddenly fall off the side of the    
  earth & nobody knows where the hell you are if you cant tell your parents at least tell a close friend.          
                                                                                                                   
  This advice can be used when you meet up with any internet stranger but in short be safe my fellow femboys.

  A good idea is to use an Amazon locker or a friend's address that may have more open minded parents and is       
  willing to help or if your friend is female/girl, but make sure they are a homie & a half To say the least.      
  Amazon lockers, you can get most packages sent to them and you can go up to them and your emailed a code to open 
  the locker when the package gets to the locker so you can open it. Good luck closeted femboys! (>'u')b           
	
  <smark>How to make DIY thigh highs with like normal materials</smark> (Made by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Oh_look_a_femboy_alt/" target="_blank">u/Oh_look_a_femboy_alt</a>)

  Okay, so you will need: 
	
  • Chalk Needle 
	
  • a thread 
	
  • A pair of thermal trousers,

  • black Black socks with a cuff (the slightly thicker but that squeezes more around ur ankle)
	
  • Cutting implements (I used a scalpel but anything sharp that won't ruin the edge is fine, you want 
	  clean cuts to its easy to sew)

  Put the thermals on, and get them smooth and comfy. With the chalk, draw a circle around your kneecap, 
  for orientation later, a line down the front of your leg and a ring around ur thigh where you wanna cut 
  them. Go a little high, too much is better than not enough, you can always roll them down. If you want 
  to, put the sock on and keep the line going over it. (I should have mentioned, do these one at a time. It
  should look like this:

 <img src="Closeted_Femboy_Help_Images/DIY_Thigh_1.jpg" style="width:412px;height:608px;margin-left: 23px">

  Get the sock, and cut off the "cuff" part, and save it for later. It will be what goes at the top of 
  the thigh highs to stop them rolling down.

  Chöp

  The cuff part should look like this:

 <img src="Closeted_Femboy_Help_Images/DIY_Thigh_2.jpg" style="width:450px;height:800px;margin-left: 23px">

  now, cut around the line on your thigh. I did this while wearing them, be very careful If you are gonna do that.

 <img src="Closeted_Femboy_Help_Images/DIY_Thigh_3.jpg" style="width:450px;height:800px;margin-left: 23px">

  Now, taken off the tube and turn it half inside out, with the top of the thigh the "right way". Put it on your 
  leg and match up the knee circle like this:

 <img src="Closeted_Femboy_Help_Images/DIY_Thigh_4.jpg" style="width:450px;height:800px;margin-left: 23px">

  Then pull it up like this:

 <img src="Closeted_Femboy_Help_Images/DIY_Thigh_5.jpg" style="width:450px;height:800px;margin-left: 23px">

  Get it all smooth, and the right height on your thigh (this is important). Roll up the bottom of the leg 
  like this:

 <img src="Closeted_Femboy_Help_Images/DIY_Thigh_6.jpg" style="width:450px;height:800px;margin-left: 23px">

  Then put on the sock:

 <img src="Closeted_Femboy_Help_Images/DIY_Thigh_7.jpg" style="width:450px;height:800px;margin-left: 23px">

  Then, without moving the whole leg bit, roll down the leg u til its near the top of the sock. Make sure the top 
  of the sock isn't rolled over itself. It should look like this:

 <img src="Closeted_Femboy_Help_Images/DIY_Thigh_8.jpg" style="width:450px;height:800px;margin-left: 23px">

  Now, the hard part, sewing. Get the needle threaded, and put it through the leg part, going in at the flat part
  and coming out the rolled edge. Then, put it through the inside edge of the sock and out. What you need to now 
  it take in the first stitch. Pull the thread almost all the way through, then tie the needle end and the loose 
  end together. Use a double knot, you do NOT want this coming undone. Here's a diagram, if it helps. (This is a 
  cross section)

 <img src="Closeted_Femboy_Help_Images/DIY_Thigh_9.jpg" style="width:360px;height:292px;margin-left: 23px">

  Now you have tied that (and pulled it tight, but not too tight you do NOT want to bunch up the fabric or snap the 
  thread) move along the divide a little, and do that again. You can flip the side you start at each time if you 
  want (I.e enter fabric at sock or leg bit). Spacing is ip to you, and how much thread you have. I may sound like
  I know how to do this, but I impulse watched some videos on this a few years ago, and that's the extent of 
  knowledge. The pattern should look like this from above:

 <img src="Closeted_Femboy_Help_Images/DIY_Thigh_10.jpg" style="width:360px;height:245px;margin-left: 23px">

  Do this all the way around, being careful not to unch up the material, and try to keep the stitches even. When 
  you get to the point you started, make a stitch, tie it, make another stitch in the same place, thi it with a 
  double knot, then cut the thread. (Don't pull it to break it, you could mess up the knot and it would unravel) 
  it should look like this:

 <img src="Closeted_Femboy_Help_Images/DIY_Thigh_11.jpg" style="width:450px;height:800px;margin-left: 23px">

  Then, flip the flap over the stitch. This stops the stitches messing with your ankle, and stops your ankle
  messing with the stitches, or your feet tearing them as you put them on.

 <img src="Closeted_Femboy_Help_Images/DIY_Thigh_12.jpg" style="width:450px;height:800px;margin-left: 23px">

  Now, take it off by rolling from the top to the bottom, and put it on the right way around. Your chalk may 
  have faded, that's fine.

 <img src="Closeted_Femboy_Help_Images/DIY_Thigh_13.jpg" style="width:450px;height:800px;margin-left: 23px">

  Now, remember that sock cuff bit from earlier? Grab that bish:

 <img src="Closeted_Femboy_Help_Images/DIY_Thigh_14.jpg" style="width:450px;height:800px;margin-left: 23px">

  Slide it up, above the thigh highs, and leave it there. Roll down the top of the thigh highs till they look 
  like this. (This step both helps the thigh highs stay on and hides any jagged edges)

 <img src="Closeted_Femboy_Help_Images/DIY_Thigh_15.jpg" style="width:450px;height:800px;margin-left: 23px">

  You will want to orient the side of the cuff that you cut to the tip of the leg part, it makes it neater. 
  Using the same method as before, stitch the close sides together. Use closer together stitches for this,
  mine were pretty fragile so I re did them (closer stitches means you will need more thread, keep that in mind)
  After you have done that, flip the cuff part over the folded over bit of the upper leg, and stitch it onto the
  leg part (not the folded bit we are making a little "pocket" that hides the folded bit. And ta-da! You have
  thigh highs, and they are technically talior made for you! The reason for doing everything while wearing them
  is because I have no idea how measurements work and fabric (and thighs) can stretch & squish, so it's hard to
  stitch something to fit. I have no clue how these would hold up in a washing machine, I hand washed mine in a 
  sink with warm water and normal clothes soap (I.e the powder that's usually in my washing machine). I probably
  wouldn't washing machine these, it could break the stitches. These do have a left and right side, usually the
  seams are up the inside of your leg, that's how I tell. The chalk should rub off easily.

  Good luck, and if anyone has any suggestions / feedback / questions feel free to message/comment or whatever.
  Enjoy!

  <mark>CREEP DETECTION</mark>
	
  The sad truth is that us femboys got deal with a load of creeps now here is how to detect em so a person 
  messages you first thing just check they're comment history see what they have commented and if they have
  not comment or post history be even more on edge people who have no history or lurkers are most likely being 
  creeps on a alt account they never post on and thats why its empty

  Two if they use kik messenger know its a place with a lot of shady shit and its more underground then lets 
  say discord and its a favoured place by abusers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sPaJxRmIPc" target="_blank">link</a> here is a video explaining it but if there from kik there 
  most likely creep

  another thing that makes creeps flock to you is if you but DMs open in your bio or in your Posts that's just a 
  creep magnet

  another way to spot a creep i if they have a default reddit name there account is more likely to be an alt 
  account they only use to be creepy so there main account doesn't get shot down

  So if there profile isn't clean then be careful but honestly a lot of creeps show there true colours quickly 
  say safe out there guys

  a lot of subreddit history or lost to time but in recent there has been some changes to the subreddit            
                                                                                                                   
  in around October 2022 there was a sub raid done by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CringetopiaRM/" target="_blank">r/CringetopiaRM</a> when a user made a post insulting a man for  
  wearing a jacket with pepe on it but most users choice more to focus on that the user was a 13 year old femboy   
  with thigh pics on the internet some had a genuine concern that the subreddit was a breeding ground for nonces   
  and that the user was being groomed even though they had no evidence but many where just homophobic or had       
  prejudice against femboys some even accusing the mod team of this sub of being of old age and child predators    
  in the end one of the moderators on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teenfemboy/" target="_blank">r/teenfemboy</a> got falsely kicked of reddit and the head mod at the time       
  u/gloomy-bass contacted all the other femboy subbreddits and with there help got reddit to help the sub out the  
  sub went into a full lock down around October 7th and new rules where put in so reddit wouldn't consider this    
  subreddit "sexualising minors" and now rules are much more strict on suggestive content to keep the subreddit    
  afloat some where annoyed by the changes but most expected them understanding the circumstances                  
                                                                                                                   
  since then the subreddits been chugging along getting a new icon on the 15th of October and now the subreddit    
  has a tradition of changing the subs logo for seasonal holidays or events                                        
                                                                                                                   
  and so far that is the subreddits history at least the history that is been remembered and now its to be         
  continued...
