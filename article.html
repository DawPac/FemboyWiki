  <mark>WHAT IS A FEMBOY ◑﹏◐?</mark>

  Hard question innit, but hopefully scrounging around all these definitions you'll figure it out. And i don't 
  want to push you into believing my own opinion of what a femboy is yet to come to a conclusion of your own 
  from multiple sources. b(￣▽￣)d

  <smark>My Opinion</smark>

  But if you want my opinion on the definition of a femboy, a femboy is a person who identifies as male and 
  dresses and or acts feminine (wearing usually thigh highs and a skirt), usually young not to be confused with 
  ladyboys and being a femboy isnt the same as being a cross dresser as femboys try to dress as cute feminine 
  boys; not cute girls and being a femboy isn't necessarily LGBT but theres a sizeable overlap

  <mark>HISTORY OF R/TEENFEMBOY</mark>                                                                                          
                                                                                                                   
  a lot of subreddit history or lost to time but in recent there has been some changes to the subreddit            
                                                                                                                   
  in around October 2022 there was a sub raid done by r/cringetopiarm when a user made a post insulting a man for  
  wearing a jacket with pepe on it but most users choice more to focus on that the user was a 13 year old femboy   
  with thigh pics on the internet some had a genuine concern that the subreddit was a breeding ground for nonces   
  and that the user was being groomed even though they had no evidence but many where just homophobic or had       
  prejudice against femboys some even accusing the mod team of this sub of being of old age and child predators    
  in the end one of the moderators on r/teenfemboy got falsely kicked of reddit and the head mod at the time       
  u/gloomy-bass contacted all the other femboy subbreddits and with there help got reddit to help the sub out the  
  sub went into a full lock down around October 7th and new rules where put in so reddit wouldn't consider this    
  subreddit "sexualising minors" and now rules are much more strict on suggestive content to keep the subreddit    
  afloat some where annoyed by the changes but most expected them understanding the circumstances                  
                                                                                                                   
  since then the subreddits been chugging along getting a new icon on the 15th of October and now the subreddit    
  has a tradition of changing the subs logo for seasonal holidays or events                                        
                                                                                                                   
  and so far that is the subreddits history at least the history that is been remembered and now its to be         
  continued...

  <mark>MEETING FELLOW FEMBOYS</mark>                                                                                           
                                                                                                                   
  Ok so you've found a femboy online you wanna meet up with amazing! us femboys hardly ever are able to meet up    
  with fellow femboys due to overbearing family or femboys being rare to find regardless if your meeting up with   
  one be safe.                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                   
  1. Meet in a very public area like a busy train station, a local high street, a town center or a restaurant.     
                                                                                                                   
  2. Reverse image search images of them to make sure there who they say you are.                                  
                                                                                                                   
  3. Tell a close person you trust what your doing. Because you don't want to suddenly fall off the side of the    
  earth & nobody knows where the hell you are if you cant tell your parents at least tell a close friend.          
                                                                                                                   
  This advice can be used when you meet up with any internet stranger but in short be safe my fellow femboys.

  A good idea is to use an Amazon locker or a friend's address that may have more open minded parents and is       
  willing to help or if your friend is female/girl, but make sure they are a homie & a half To say the least.      
  Amazon lockers, you can get most packages sent to them and you can go up to them and your emailed a code to open 
  the locker when the package gets to the locker so you can open it. Good luck closeted femboys! (>'u')b
