| a lot of subreddit history or lost to time but in recent there has been some changes to the subreddit            |
|                                                                                                                  |
| in around October 2022 there was a sub raid done by r/cringetopiarm when a user made a post insulting a man for  |
| wearing a jacket with pepe on it but most users choice more to focus on that the user was a 13 year old femboy   |
| with thigh pics on the internet some had a genuine concern that the subreddit was a breeding ground for nonces   |
| and that the user was being groomed even though they had no evidence but many where just homophobic or had       |
| prejudice against femboys some even accusing the mod team of this sub of being of old age and child predators    |
| in the end one of the moderators on r/teenfemboy got falsely kicked of reddit and the head mod at the time       |
| u/gloomy-bass contacted all the other femboy subbreddits and with there help got reddit to help the sub out the  |
| sub went into a full lock down around October 7th and new rules where put in so reddit wouldn't consider this    |
| subreddit "sexualising minors" and now rules are much more strict on suggestive content to keep the subreddit    |
| afloat some where annoyed by the changes but most expected them understanding the circumstances                  |
|                                                                                                                  |
| since then the subreddits been chugging along getting a new icon on the 15th of October and now the subreddit    |
| has a tradition of changing the subs logo for seasonal holidays or events                                        |
|                                                                                                                  |
| and so far that is the subreddits history at least the history that is been remembered and now its to be         |
| continued...                                                                                                     |
|                                                                                                                  |
